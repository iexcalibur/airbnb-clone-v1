This project is an Airbnb clone, a web application that replicates the functionality of the popular accommodation marketplace, Airbnb. 
It has been developed using Next.js, React.js, and TypeScript, providing a modern and efficient frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.

For data storage and management, the project utilizes server-side MongoDB and Prisma. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability, 
making it suitable for handling large amounts of data. Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for 
TypeScript and JavaScript, simplifying database access and query operations.

One of the key features of this Airbnb clone is the integration of NextAuth for Google authentication. 
NextAuth is a flexible authentication library for Next.js applications that supports various authentication providers, 
including Google. This enables users to sign in to the application using their Google accounts, providing a seamless and convenient authentication experience.
